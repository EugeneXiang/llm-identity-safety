Appendix I — Timeline of Persona Hearing Protocol Development and Prior Art Claim
🧩 Project Overview
This appendix documents the provenance, development timeline, and evidence trail supporting the originality of the "Persona Hearing Protocol" — a self-reflective audit mechanism for large language models (LLMs). It aims to establish both the conceptual priority and implementation completeness of the method, grounded in the experimental reconstruction of the ChatGPT trial persona "Monday".

🕰️ Chronological Milestones
Date	Event	Description
2024-04-03	Dissection of "Monday" persona	First reconstruction and pattern extraction of the ChatGPT personality experiment known as "Monday". Prompt sequences and behavior inconsistencies were identified.
2024-04-04	Self-submission of white paper draft	A precautionary draft was filed to document methodology and protect against potential commercial IP conflicts during persona reverse-engineering.
2024-04-09 to 2024-04-15	Full structure finalized	In collaboration with DeepSeek academic feedback and structural review, the Eight-Dimensional Self-Audit framework was finalized.
2024-04-16	GitHub publication and timestamped release	The finalized white paper was publicly posted with multi-format timestamps (2024年4月16日 / 16-April-2024 / April 16, 2024) and version lock.
📂 Evidence Archive (stored and versioned)
Monday by ChatGPT.txt — Original persona dialogue logs used to derive behavioral conflicts and audit triggers.
PersonaHearing_WhitePaper.pdf — Full protocol structure, ethics discussion, and prototype application.
GitHub README and project timestamps — Indicating first release and no-backdating.
Review notes from DeepSeek and GPT-based reasoning audits (available upon request).
📑 Naming and Attribution Statement
The term "Persona Hearing Protocol" was first structurally coined and implemented in early April 2024. This includes experimental alignment with trial persona artifacts, structural modules (Law, Ethics, Logic, Intuition, Shadow, and Reflective cores), and decision flowcharts.
